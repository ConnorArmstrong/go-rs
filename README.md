# go-rs

This is an implementation of the game of go in rust.

The plan is to include a bot based off of a montecarlo tree search that plays better than me.



To Do:

- [ ] Persistant MCTS tree via pruning
- [ ] Threading for non-blocking GUI
- [ ] Self Play and Statistics
- [ ] Command Line Arguments
